to compile use g++ -O2 -mssse3 main.cpp

Effectively compressing sorted integer arrays and performing highly efficient operations on the compressed arrays.
Operation include : 
  -Fast sequential scanning (iteration) speed over the compressed lists. 
  -Fast random lookup of docIds on the compressed lists.
  -Fast finding intersections of the compressed lists. (lookup in combination of several bitmaps index)

Compression need to be Data-type dependent and Data distribution dependent.
Decompress small vector into CPU cache (dont write it back to ram)
-Decoding loop over cache resident compressed vector
-Avoid control dependencies within decoding loop (Prevent loop-pipelining)
-avoid data dependencies between loop iteration


Memcache RPC latency:
  Server takes 70 000 ns to turn around data
  Total latency 200 000 ns within a rack
  400 000 -500 000 ns across datacenter

l1 cache reference = 0.5 ns
Branch mispredict = 5ns
l2 cache reference = 7ns
mutex lock/unlock = 25 ns
Main memory reference = 100ns
Compress 1K w/cheap compression = 3,000 ns
Send 2K bytes over 1 Gbps network = 20,000 ns
Read 1MB sequentially from memory  = 250,000 ns
Round trip within same dataenter = 500,000 ns
Disk seek = 10,000,000 ns
Read 1 MB sequentially from disk = 20,000,000 ns
send packet CA->Netherlands->CA = 150,000,000 ns
